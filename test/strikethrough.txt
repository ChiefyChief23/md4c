# Strikethrough

With the flag `MD_FLAG_STRIKETHROUGH`, MD4C enables extension for recognition
of strike-through spans.

Strikethrough text is any text wrapped in tildes (~).

```````````````````````````````` example
~Hi~ Hello, world!
.
<p><del>Hi</del> Hello, world!</p>
````````````````````````````````

Any number of tildes may be used on either side of the text; they do not need
to match, and they cannot be nested.

```````````````````````````````` example
This ~text~~~~ is ~~~~curious~.
.
<p>This <del>text</del> is <del>curious</del>.</p>
````````````````````````````````

As with regular emphasis delimiters, a new paragraph will cause the cessation
of parsing a strikethrough:

```````````````````````````````` example
This ~~has a

new paragraph~~.
.
<p>This ~~has a</p>
<p>new paragraph~~.</p>
````````````````````````````````
