# Permissive E-mail Autolinks

With the flag `MD_FLAG_PERMISSIVEEMAILAUTOLINKS`, MD4C enables more permissive recognition
of e-mail addresses and transforms them to autolinks, even if they do not exactly follow
the syntax of autolink as specified in CommonMark specification.

This is standard CommonMark e-mail autolink:

```````````````````````````````` example
E-mail: <mailto:john.doe@gmail.com>
.
<p>E-mail: <a href="mailto:john.doe@gmail.com">mailto:john.doe@gmail.com</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

With the permissive autolinks enabled, this is sufficient:

```````````````````````````````` example
E-mail: john.doe@gmail.com
.
<p>E-mail: <a href="mailto:john.doe@gmail.com">john.doe@gmail.com</a></p>
````````````````````````````````
